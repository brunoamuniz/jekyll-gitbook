# How it works

## Convert Figma into a Flutter project

To use FlutterVision with Figma, you need to follow these steps:

1. Organize your Figma project (check our tips on the next page);
2. Create a new project on [FlutterVision](https://web.fluttervision.com/) and choose Figma as input;
3. Fill the credentials with: (1) [Figma Token](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens) - it's unique for each Figma account - and (2) Project Key - you can get it on the project URL;
4. After the AI work, please check each page and component. If necessary, you can make some adjustments;
5. You can export and run your Flutter project.
