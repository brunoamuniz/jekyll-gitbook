#### 1) How to create an account?

There are two options: (1) clicking in "Create an account" and filling the form and (2) clicking in "Login with Google" and integrating FlutterVision with your Google account.&#x20;

#### 2) Login

After the Login, you'll be redirected to the user page.

#### 3) Forgot Password

Request a new password, that you'll receive by e-mail.

#### 4) Create Project

Create a new project redirecting you to the upload page.

Set the Project name. This name will be used in the download file name.&#x20;

&#x20;**IMPORTANT: NAMES CAN ONLY CONTAIN** A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and underscore. Otherwise, the application cannot be compiled properly. Even the path (e.g. C:\Users\steve\Documents\project\_name) must comply with these rules.
